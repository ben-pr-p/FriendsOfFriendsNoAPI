# selenium-friends-scraper

Selenium-Friends-Scraper implements a web crawler that crawls your friends of friends network.

### Usage
The current version is written using Selenium's Firefox web driver, which means you need Firefox installed. 

Soon, versions will be rewritten for use with Chrome, Safari, and maybe IE.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ben-pr-p/selenium-friends-scraper.git
$ cd selenium-friends-scraper
$ source venv/bin/activate

```
or, if you have `pip`
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ben-pr-p/selenium-friends-scraper.git
