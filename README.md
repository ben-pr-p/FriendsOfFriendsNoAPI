# Selenium-Friends-Scraper

Facebook disabled its "friends of friends" feature on April 30th of this year. This implements a slow web crawler that gets it manually.

### Usage
The current version is written using Selenium's Firefox web driver, which means you need Firefox installed. 

Soon, versions will be rewritten for use with Chrome, Safari, and maybe IE.

### Installation

Either run:

```sh
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ python main.py
```
or, if you have `pip`
```sh
$ pip install selenium
$ python main.py
```
